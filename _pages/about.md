Hello, my name is Ashley Chraya. I recently graduated in June 2021 with BS-MS dual degree with majors in physics from the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Mohali, India](https://www.iisermohali.ac.in/). In broad terms, my research interests include black hole physics, gravitational physics, stellar evolution and cosmology with the focus on testing general relativity. When I am not doing physics, you will find me watching a cricket match or shadow batting. Feel free to contact me to discuss anything related to physics and cricket.

About this website
======
The purpose of this website is multi-folds, but the primary goal is outreach. 

In the past 5 years at IISER Mohali, I encountered many instances where I felt some chunks in books that are not very obvious to understand. In hindsight, it required many more bits and pieces to be studied before that particular concept could sink into my brain. If someone had given me direction on where to look in these particular instances, it would have saved me time and effort. 

Hence, I plan to update [Notes]({{ site.url }}/notes/) page with my handwritten and latex-made notes on some of the topics, which interests me. These notes aim to bring together relevant material to better understand the concept and hopefully find some insights. Additionally, I plan to update [Literature]({{ site.url }}/literature/) page with links of notes, books, video lectures etc, and my comments on various topics, which I have found useful.

Finally, I plan to update [Now]({{ site.url }}/now/) page with material I am currently studying.

I plan to keep updating pages for next few months.

Personal Philosophy
======
I think physics is like a big forest with different floras. Firstly, we hover over the forest through a helicopter getting rough ideas of what is going on in what field. Then according to one's interest, one lands at one place to dig deeper up to a certain level, till he/she moves to another region to learn different techniques of digging to better understand that region. Rarely, in this pursuit, one finds a way how this new technique can be used in a better way to explore the older land.
