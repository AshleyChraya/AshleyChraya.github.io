Hello there! I am Ashley Chraya. I recently graduated in June 2021 with a BS-MS dual degree with majors in physics from the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Mohali, India](https://www.iisermohali.ac.in/). My research interests broadly lie in gravitational waves and black hole physics. That being said, I am very early in my career and willing to work on just about anything in theoretical and computational astrophysics. Previously, I have worked in astrophysical inferences using GWs data analysis tools, cosmological parameter estimation using Bayesian inference, cosmology with GWs, field-theoretic aspects of gravitational fields, the post-merger phase of BBH mergers and the dynamics of astrophysical magnetic fields. 

I am also interested in the application of machine learning and deep learning in astrophysics. Currently, I am interested in the applications of neural networks in gravitational waveform modelling and gravitational wave data analysis. I also have a strong interest in Python programming (thanks to my mentor). I have been working with Python for the past 1.5 years, and I have developed a deep interest in it. My experience includes data analysis tools, computer vision models, machine learning and deep learning models using various Python libraries and frameworks. I also enjoy exploring new technologies and methods to improve my skills and broaden my horizons.

When I am not doing physics or coding, you will find me watching a cricket match, shadow batting, or listening to Punjabi music.

I plan to update [Notes]({{ site.url }}/notes/) page with my handwritten and latex-made notes on some of the topics, which interests me. Additionally, I plan to update [Talks]({{site.url}}/talks) page with links to talks I presented, [Codes]({{site.url}}/codes) page with codes I have used in my research, [Resources]({{ site.url }}/resources/) page with links to useful webpages.
