Hello there! I am Ashley Chraya. I recently graduated in June 2021 with a BS-MS dual degree with majors in physics from the [Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Mohali, India](https://www.iisermohali.ac.in/). In broad terms, my research interests lie in the connection between classical black hole physics, multimessenger astronomy, galaxy evolution, and cosmology. That being said, I am very early in my career and willing to work on just about anything in astrophysics. In fact, I have enjoyed working from the observational, computational to the core theoretical side of physics in the past. When I am not doing physics, you will find me watching a cricket match, shadow batting, or listening to Punjabi music.

About this website
======
The purpose of this website is multi-folds, but the primary goal is outreach. 

In the past five years at IISER Mohali, I encountered many instances where I felt some chunks in books that are not very obvious to understand. In hindsight, it required many more bits and pieces to be studied before that particular concept could sink into my brain. If someone had given me direction on where to look in these specific instances, it would have saved me time and effort. 

Hence, I plan to update [Notes]({{ site.url }}/notes/) page with my handwritten and latex-made notes on some of the topics, which interests me. These notes aim to bring together relevant material to understand the concept better and hopefully find some insights. Additionally, I plan to update [Resources]({{ site.url }}/resources/) page with links to useful webpages, notes, books, video lectures, etc.

I plan to keep updating these pages for the next few months.
