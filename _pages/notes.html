excerpt: "'<small>I think one of the motives of science is to leave some kind of memorial behind oneself.
And people can do that in a variety of ways. They can make discoveries and be remembered for that. But there 
is also a modest role a scientist can play, and that is to assemble information and material which, in long run, will be helpful
to others. [...] The idea that one's scientific life has to be motivated by the off-chance that one may make great discovery,
 and be remembered for that was too risky, too much of a gamble. I preferred the more modest approach.</small>' -Isaac Newton"
