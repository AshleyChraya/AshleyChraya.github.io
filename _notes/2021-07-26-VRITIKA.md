This report was prepared for completion of the summer project on QNMs. Topics discussed in it are:
1) The role of the boundary condition in the case of black hole system
2) Connection between QNMs and light ring
3) WKB approximation (discussed explicitly validity of this method. This issue is intrinsically related to the connections between QNMs and light ring) and Leaver's method for Schwarszchild and RN BH to get eigenvalues of the Master's equation
The code repository for for finding eigenvalues with the above said methods can eb found here: [Code Repository](https://github.com/AshleyChraya/QNM_Vritika)
