This report was prepared for the completion of the summer project on QNMs. The code repository for finding eigenvalues with WKB approximation and Continued fraction methods can be found here: [Code Repository](https://github.com/AshleyChraya/QNM_Vritika)

Topics discussed in it are:
1) The role of the boundary condition in the case of black hole system
2) Connection between QNMs and light ring
3) WKB approximation (discussed explicitly validity of this method. This issue is intrinsically related to the connections between QNMs and light ring) and Leaver's method for Schwarzschild and RN BH to get eigenvalues of the Master's equation.
