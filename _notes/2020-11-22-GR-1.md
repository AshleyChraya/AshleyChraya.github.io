These lecture notes closely follow [video lectures](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaNkJORnlhZkgIyPFNxhJPIVewGckJCGr) on General Relativity by Eric Poisson at the Perimeter Institute. The content here is closed followed from his book titled "A Relativist's Toolkit". Some of the content which was not discussed at all or at length are covered in the book. I also made notes of these which can be found [here](/notes/2020-11-01-GR-1).
