These lecture notes closely follow [video lectures](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLaNkJORnlhZkgIyPFNxhJPIVewGckJCGr) on General Relativity by Prof. Eric Poisson at the Perimeter Institute. Some of the content which was not discussed at all or at length in these video lectures are covered in the book. I have also made notes of the book which can be found [here](/notes/2020-11-01-GR-1).
